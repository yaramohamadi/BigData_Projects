This is a collection of queries and analytics for NoSQL Databases like ***MongoDB***, ***Neo4j***, ***Cassandra***, and ***Elasticsearch*** for data analytics 

## MongoDB
Database creation and Queries for crawled stock trades from [Sahamyab](https://www.sahamyab.com/), a smart investment network in Iran.

#### Sample query:

<img src="mongodb/imgs/3.png" data-canonical-src="mongodb/imgs/3.png" height="250" />

#### MongoDB Compass sample report:

<img src="mongodb/imgs/2.png" data-canonical-src="mongodb/imgs/2.png" height="250" />

## Neo4j
After creating Nodes for each dataset of a Lord of the Rings film, we've written queries in `Cypher` to extract relevant data from created graphs for each query.

## Cassandra
Queries for Free Music Archive (FMA). As we don't have joins in Cassandra, we've created a special table for each requested query and after loading the table's data, we applied each requested query.

## Elasticsearch
Queries for crawled tweets from the Sahamyab site which are Smart investment network in Iran. Then a management dashboard was designed with Kibana.
